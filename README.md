# Hello! I am Ethan Atchley! :wave:
I am a 14 year old hoping to become a software engineer in the future, and I am currently working on a couple of projects that are linux related! I am a total linux nerd, and I'll talk you to death about it. I am also a developer of the Ataraxia Linux project. I am working on an OpenRC port for it! :D


# Currently learning:

How to make a linux distro

Golang

C?

And much more...
